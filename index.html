  <b>Senior Quality Inspector</b><br>Upsher-Smith Laboratories - Maple Grove, MN<br>December 2011 to April 2018
  <p>I was most recently a Senior Quality Inspector at Upsher-Smith Labs. I inspected finished goods,
packaging components, labeling, and sampled raw materials for our lab. I put up and pulled stability
studies. I am fork lift certified and managed the inspections area to maintain flow for other Quality
Inspectors. I processed all samples from our production plants in Plymouth, MN and Denver, CO
and brought them to our lab for testing. I am proficient in SAP and have been using it for 12 years. I
    maintained all reserve samples and conducted monthly cycle counts for accuracy.</p>
